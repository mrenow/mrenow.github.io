            <h1>Hello World! What is this all about??</h1>
            <p>
                Well, I finally did it. Writing something, anything. Really should not have taken so long, but alas how procrastination and feature creep takes its toll.
                I thought that perhaps writing the content first was wise, and let the styling and gimmicks form around it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now what to put here? I hope this home takes the place of my previous diary "system" which constantly begs to be forgotten. However,
                I dont think its going to be practical to put <i>all</i> of my mind diaryhea in here starting off, so I should form a list of priority content:
                <ul>
                    <li> Cool math I'm learning </li>
                    <li> Any things ive learned about life </li>
                </ul>
                Is that it? I think thats it for now.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also hope I dont draw too much inspiration form the quirky stuff from other people's websites. I dont want anything to come out of myself
                thats not from myself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In future however, I hope that I can use this website as a multiplatform diarying application which opens on every new tab so I remember to be SELF AWARE
                Also a place to put interactive stuff
                and maybe fun stuff
                and data tracking stuff (for myself, not you)
                and probably whatever else I feel like.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well I have work tomorrow, I suppose thats where I leave it for now. Adios!
