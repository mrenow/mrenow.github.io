            <h1>How to make a website (And potentially other things)</h1>
            <p>
                So I have wanted a website done for many years, and I'm finally pushing past the perfectionist inside by adhering to a number of ostensibly useful project mindsets:
            </p>
            <h2>
                Get tangible stuff done immediately
            </h2>
            <p>
                Many a project has just been left in the planning phase! This appears to be because planning is boring, and I dont like doing boring things. Though we have learned to define requirements and build frameworks - like come on! - its not like I even know what my requirements are half the time. The only person who is making me do this is myself, and my requirements are going to flip on it's head in the time it takes to plan. Furthermore, rapidly prototyping content actually helps me figure out what my requirements even are, as I see the real consequences of my often misguided desires.  
            </p>
            <h2>
                Annoy yourself
            </h2>
            <p>
                I am the type to clean up a report, or code, or an animation for hours because of small inconveniences that I can improve upon. Why can't I abuse this to my own benefit? If my website exists and looks awful or feels clunky, I'm going to end up spending all my free time making it less annoying.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Put it in your face
            </h2>
            <p>
                Every time I forget about a project, I forget about it for a *long* time, and when I come back to it all my goals and all the little details have been forgotten. So, just find a way to not forget. I am achieving this by making the website my new tab page. Hopefully I can nerd snipe myself and add lots of features and gadgets to the page.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Learn stuff by procrastinating
            </h2>
            <p>
                Big libraries are scary. So its maybe a good idea to use trivial or fun features as an excuse to implement the framework for more massive but important things. Im planning to implement the backend through some fun analytics stuff, like how many times ive opened a new tab.
